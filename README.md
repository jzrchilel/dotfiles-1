# my dotfiles

nvim configs are based on https://github.com/crivotz/nv-ide

Commented out a lot of plugins because I don't know how to use them, I don't need them right now, and changed a lot for my own needs.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:serene-dev/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/alacritty/.alacritty.yml ~/.alacritty.yml
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/config/tmux ~/.config/tmux
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
